* Q1

** Q1(a)
- Punctutations were removed from the input data, and words containing
  numbers like l77t code were also removed.
- The bag of words model was implemented.
- Optimal parameters are stored in a pickle file.
- Train accuracy is \(71.25\%\) while test accuracy is \(66.54\%\).

** Q1(b)
- Expected random prediction accuracy is \(20\%\). Predicting the
  maximum class, the accuracy will be \(66.086\%\).
- As compared to random prediction, the accuracy gained is \(36.08\%\),
  but there is no significant gain compared to maximum prediction.

** Q1(c)

- Class "5" has the highest value of the diagonal entry. This is also
  the class with highest number of samples in the training set.
- It is also seen that classes that have a high prior, pull the
  decision towards themselves: most of the false predictions belong to
  class "5", then to class "4" and so on. The number of training
  samples from each class is listed below.
- Summing up the column for class "5", we can see 11984 = 85.6\% of
  samples are predicted as belonging to class "5". 13.44\% to class
  "4", 0.8\% to class "3", 0\% to class "2" and 0.157 to class "1".
\begin{align*}
&\text{Category 1:} 2529 =5.05\%\\
&\text{Category 2:} 2638 =5.28\%\\
&\text{Category 3:} 5634 =11.27\%\\
&\text{Category 4:} 13267 =26.53\%\\
&\text{Catgeory 5:} 25932 =51.86\%
\end{align*}

** Q1(d)

- Accuracy on test set is \(64.77\%\).
- One would expect the accuracy to improve, but it actually goes down
  by 1.77\%.
